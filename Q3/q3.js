// Question 3.
// There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
// Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
// You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.

//I am going to be honest, I did not understand this question much
//had to go through stackoverflow
